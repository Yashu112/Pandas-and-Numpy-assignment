    "Ans. Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing and analyzing data and drawing meaningful insights from it using various statistical methods, such as mean, median, mode, covariance, etc and by visualizing the data using different types of plots."

    "\n",
    "- **Descriptive Statistics** - Descriptive Statistics is the statistics which deals with orgainzing and summarizing a set of data that we have. Here we find out different measures of central tendency and variability such as mean, median, mode, covariance, probability distribution, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example- Suppose we collect the height of all students in class and find the mean height, median height, etc. Then this is descriptive statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inferential Statistics** - Inferential Statistics is the statistics in which we use the already measured data that we have to draw insights about a larger set of data. We take a sample data and using the sample data we predict about a larger population data. Here we have Z-test, t-test, and find p value and significance value, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example- Suppose there are elections in a state. After the elections we carry out exit polls, and collect sample data about voting from people of different regions and use this data to predict the overall election results. Then this is an example of inferential statistics."

    "4. Ratio - the data can be categorized, it can be ranked, it can be evenly spaced in intervals and it also has a zero point. At zero point, the value of variable is zero, it doesn't exist. Example, height and weight measurements."

    "Ans. It is important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data because it helps us in deciding which measures of central tendency and variability we can use and in which way we can draw out conlusion from our data. For example, at nominal level, we can only find mode, not mean or median. At the ordinal level, we can find mode as well as median, but not mean. At the interval level, we can find mode, median as well as mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Example- Suppose we collect the height of all students in class and find the mean height, median height, etc. Then this is descriptive statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inferential Statistics** - Inferential Statistics is the statistics in which we use the already measured data that we have to draw insights about a larger set of data. We take a sample data and using the sample data we predict about a larger population data. Here we have Z-test, t-test, and find p value and significance value, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example- Suppose there are elections in a state. After the elections we carry out exit polls, and collect sample data about voting from people of different regions and use this data to predict the overall election results. Then this is an example of inferential statistics."

    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "1. Measures of central tendency -  \n",
    "    - Mean/average - It is found by dividing the sum of all data points by total number of data points. It is the average of data.\n",

    "    - Median - It denotes the central value. We have two cases - \n",
    "        - When total number of data points, **N** is odd, the data points are first sorted in ascending order, the data point at **(N+1)/2**<sup>th</sup> position is the median.\n",
    "        - When total number of data points **N**, is even, the data points are first sorted in ascending order, then the median is calculated by taking the average of data points at **N/2**<sup>th</sup> and **N/2 + 1**<sup>th</sup> position.\n",
    "    - Mode- It is the data point which occurs maximum number of times in our data. The data point with maximum frequency of occurence is our mode.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Measures of Variability -\n",
    "    - Range - it can simply be found by taking the difference of maximum data point and minimum datta point. \n",
    "    >$Range = x_{max} - x_{min}$\n",
    "    - Variance - it is found by dividing the squares of differences of data points and mean by the total number of data points\n",
